convert this inverted value to an unsigned int, and store it. output the original value, the unsigned value with the bits inverted, and that same inverted value plus 1,
each in binary representation and on one line. on the next line, output the original value, the signed inverted value, and the signed inverted value plus 1, 
each in decimal representation. these two lines should be formatted such that they look like a table, where the values in the same column are centered. you can add column 
headers as well if you like. all binary values should have leading zeros so they are all 32 bits long (assuming int values are 32 bits, which they usually are).
note: Flipping all bits and adding oneâ€”ring any bells? Can you perhaps already deduce what the decimal output will be before you run the program? */
